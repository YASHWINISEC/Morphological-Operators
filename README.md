# üßÆ Morphological Operators Project

## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **morphological image processing operations** in computer vision.  
Morphological transformations are shape-based techniques used to process binary and grayscale images.  
They are essential for cleaning noisy data, enhancing object structures, and preparing images for further tasks like **segmentation**, **edge detection**, or **object tracking**.

## üéØ Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To understand the concept of morphological image transformations.  
- To explore core operations such as **erosion**, **dilation**, **opening**, and **closing**.  
- To visualize how these operations affect image structure and quality.  
- To use these operations for removing noise and refining image shapes.

## üßæ Working Process
1. **Input Image:** Load an image and convert it into grayscale or binary form.  
2. **Structuring Element:** Define a kernel (matrix) for transformation.  
3. **Operation Execution:** Apply the morphological operation:  
   - **Erosion:** Shrinks bright regions and removes small white noise.  
   - **Dilation:** Expands bright areas and fills small holes.  
   - **Opening:** Removes small noise while preserving shape.  
   - **Closing:** Fills tiny gaps or dark holes inside objects.  
4. **Output Visualization:** Compare before and after images to observe transformation results.
